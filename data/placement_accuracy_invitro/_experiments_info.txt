Room temperature: 70F

In-vitro phantoms:
* Phantom A - 22g wax
* Phantom A no skin - 22g wax without gaze layer
* Phantom B - 45g wax
* Phantom C - 90g wax

Experiments:
* Open-loop: Single-attempt stepwise (5mm steps) insertions without any correction to characterize each phantom deviation after 10cm insertion length
	
* Closed-loop: Single-attempt stepwise (5mm steps) insertion with MPC trajectory correction (10cm total insertion length)
alpha = 0.65
w = [1.0, 1.0, 3.5, 3.5]
H = 4
